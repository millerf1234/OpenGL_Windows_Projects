//   File History:
//             - Created by Forrest Miller on July 16, 2018
//             - Reorganized on November 8, 2018 
//                   Removed several includes that could have their scope reduced
//             - Renamed on January 4, 2019 to "GlobalIncludes.h"
//                   Previous name was "ProjectSetup.h" 
//                   Change was made to avoid confusion with code which pertains specifically
//                       to RenderProjects
//             - Replaced GLAD with newer version

//After including the main GLM header, it is still necessary to include
//some additional GLM extensions that are used in this project:

//'type_ptr' is a conversion function that allows GLM vector and GLM 
// matrix types to be accessed as though they are just arrays through
// a GLfloat* to their first element. This is necessary for sending them
// as uniforms to shader programs.
#include "glm/gtc/type_ptr.hpp"   

//'quaternion' is a special data type used to efficently and cleanly express
// rotations in 3D. They are both cheaper and more robust than relying on Euler angles.
#include "glm/gtc/quaternion.hpp" 

//'matrix_transform' provides functions for creating several useful matrices that 
// are used within the course of rendering. 
#include "glm/gtc/matrix_transform.hpp"
