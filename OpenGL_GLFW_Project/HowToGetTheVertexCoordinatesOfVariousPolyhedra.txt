Hey so I can get the vertex coordinates for various polyhedra by 
going onto Wolfram Alpha and extracting it from there. 


So if I go to Wolfram Alpha and type in something like:

        PolyhedronData["SmallTriakisOctahedron", "VertexCoordinates"]

This will give me the coordinates for all 14 vertices for the SmallTriakisOctahedron.




The only problem with this data from Wolfram though is that the vertex coordinates are 
given as exact values (i.e. as fractions containing square roots and such rather than 
decimal values).  [Yes I realize it's probably really easy to tell Wolfram to give the 
values in decimal, but I hardly use Wolfram enough to know how to do that]

Actually I probably should just look that up...
Here's how to do it :

        N(PolyhedronData["SmallTriakisOctahedron", "VertexCoordinates"])




And with that being said, here are the vertices for the SmallTriakisOctahedron:

{{-0.5, -0.5, -0.5},
{-0.5, -0.5, 0.5},
{-0.5, 0.5, -0.5},
{-0.5, 0.5, 0.5},
{0., 0., -1.20711},
{0., 0., 1.20711},
{0., -1.20711, 0.},
{0., 1.20711, 0.},
{0.5, -0.5, -0.5},
{0.5, -0.5, 0.5},
{0.5, 0.5, -0.5},
{0.5, 0.5, 0.5},
{-1.20711, 0., 0.},
{1.20711, 0., 0.}}



I suppose I still need to figure out a way to get the correct triangle ordering if I'm
ever going to actually render one of these polyhedrons... 
Actually here I figured it out. To get the data, do the following Wolfram queries
(while also making sure to replace NAME with the polyhedron's name):

        Vertices ->    N(PolyhedronData["NAME", "VertexCoordinates"])
        Edges    ->    N(PolyhedronData["NAME", "EdgeIndices"])
        Faces    ->    N(PolyhedronData["NAME", "FaceIndices"])
