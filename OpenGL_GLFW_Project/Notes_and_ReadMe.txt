This is just an extra text file containing random notes related to a whole range of topics. This means 
that this file includes notes/research/weblinks towards ideas I have going forward but haven't implemented yet,
random thoughts I have/had whilest writing the code (including explination and justification of how I expect/hope for
things to work), and references/links to resource files that either are currently being used or that I think I might
like to use.

I created this file on July 25, 2018,  but the plan is to fill it in as I go...

//FUTURE IDEAS:

//Overall idea of project in its current state:
// Create a renderer that draws a scene.
//       First I need a camera object and a way to represent/store world object vertices
//		 To do that well, it would be helpful to have a working OpenGL interface to simplyfy shader code 
//				while still maintaining all the flexibility that comes with the low-level programming. This
//				also means not shooting myself in the foot by writing slow/inefficent code.
//
//
// So I have been working for a bit now on the OpenGL interface, and I have been thinking it would really be helpful
// to give my Renderer/Engine a name. I have been doing some research on the internet trying to think of a good name.
// Here are some ideas I have had thus far:
//			(Greek Mathematicins) :
//					Archytas    --  Believed that arithmatic, not geometry, was the true language of proofs.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archytas
//									  Defined (but didn't invent) the Harmonic mean, which is important in Projective Geometry   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean
//									  Pronounced "Ar-he-tas"   (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXqZXDd5sUo )
//					Pappus      --  Considered to be the 'father' of projective geometry. 
//
//			(Minearls/Elements)
//					Cerium      --  Metal element
//									  Non-Toxic
//					Galium      --  Semi-Metal element
//					
//			(Catchy made-up words that sounds sorta like real words)
//					GPUlutions  -- like 'GPU' + 'Solutions' (no)
//					UniBuffer   -- like as in one system for all your buffer needs
//                  
//
//
