Ashima Arts has kindly made available a number of ready-to-use GLSL noise shader functions. 

These are all released under the MIT license, and are thus pretty much free to use for
whatever purpose.

It should be noted that some of these files rely upon the same utility functions (i.e. mod289() and
permute()) which will lead to naming conflicts if using multiple of these files within the same 
ShaderProgram.
