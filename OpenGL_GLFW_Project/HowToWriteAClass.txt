How To Write A Class circa August 2019

[These are not yet in any particular order]

  -)Have all constructors delegate object initialization
    to a class-internal initialization constructor. 

  -)

  -)Use pImpl idiom with a std::unique_ptr for
    all classes which are intended to be permanent 
    fixtures. Experimental and RenderDemo Specific 
    classes are highly encouraged to use pImpl (it
    often is the case that these experiments wind
    up proving to be useful enough to not warrant a
    rewrite. Having the implementation be hidden 
    behind the opaque pointer allows for the
    implementation to be easily updated as necessary

              ( this next one is more of a todo than a rule, but still... )
                  

    -) Come up with a consistent style for how exception                                                      [  To reacquaint myself with this topic in the future,
       handling will come into play for both implementation [internal] code and                                          look into why constructors should not be labeled with 'noexcept' ]
       client [external] code. My thinking thus far on this issue is essentially
       it all boils down to which of the following 2 options proves the more annoying
       for client code to account for: 

                 i)   [EXCEPTION HANDLING] Expecting cleint code to Accurately and Appropriately use try/catch statements
                                          (including accounting for catching everything expected to be caught by client code
                                           across potentially numerous situations which may each have unique exception risks)
                                           [This can be compounded on by the usage of introducing new exception types]
                                           
                                                        Perhaps I should say I believe with proper coding discipline, good design and 
                                                        perhaps most importantly, "perfected documentation" [I use quotes because there is no such thing],
                                                        the complexity of error handling
                                                        can be minimized to enough of an extent to actually achieve 

          or       

                ii)   [TWO-PHASE CONSTRUCTION] Always expecting client code to use 2-phase construction when creating objects




  Here's some more thoughts:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   
   ***    Easy rule for client code to remember (i.e the client just needs to
             know 'Always do this' whenever creating objects rather than 
             a potential labyrinth of rules brought about by exception handling) 
                          
            
   ***    Exception handling has changed a lot over the past, with quite a lot of
             older components being deprecated and removed. Perhaps even exception handling
             has undergone the most deprecation of any area within C++ 
                          
            
   ***   Error Handling is a complete mess. Structured Error Handling? Vectored Error Handling? 
             There's like different compiler settings for error handling even [at least within MSVC]
             which means the behavior of code may (in fact almost certainly) become dependent on 
             having specific compiler settings configured. (For big single projects this is less of 
             an issue but don't forget the larger goal here is to come up with a general universal set
             of rules for writing classes)
             
            
   ***   Exception handling can very quickly exponentiate the number of valid paths through code. Remember
             that one Guru-of-the-Week blog post from the early 2000's. I'm sure this hasn't changed.

   ***    How the heck do you construct unique_ptr's using 2-phase? What about placing 
          objects in collections such as vectors/arrays/stacks/queues/etc? 

   ***   It's just so much darn clean to write code which uses the normal construction syntax
         if a dynamic allocation isn't involved. [IS THIS TRUE? CAN A STACK CONSTRUCTED               <----------------------------- I actually think answering these questions should provide a key
         OBJECT STILL THROW? IF YES, COULD IT BE WRITTEN SO A STACK CONSTRUCTED OBJECT                <----------------------------- part in determining the least-worst approach
         WILL NEVER THROW?]

   ***  Client code will most likely at some point forget that two-phase construction is required

   ***  Worst of all, 2-phase construction just kinda sucks. It makes simple code a lot more ugly.
        (Just go take a look at the Generator.cpp code from Star Suzerian to see sorta what I mean)

   ***  Two-phase construction doesn't necessarily replace the requirements for 
        client code to detect and report errors beyond failures to an object's construction. Thus,
        there is very much a chance exception handling will still be required by the client code anyways.
        If 'try/catch' statements are still used/required frequently, having to then
        construct objects with 2-phase-construction gives the worst of both worlds. 

           In other words, if error handling is going to be present regardless, it in theory 
           should be a lot more convenient to use it and not have to use 2-phase construction.


       Basically what I am saying is any code that HAS ABSOLUTLY NO other choice than to use exception handling
       is already in a bad position but will not be made much worse by expecting it to check for object construction failure.

Okay I've been thinking about this for a while now and I recently had the thought that perhaps it could be useful to approach this issue through
the lens of how I (and maybe other programmers [one day]) will be using/interacting with the resulting code for the vast majority of its existence.
For the type of code I am planning to write (or rewrite), chances are if the code is part of a class then the intention is to have it be something 
I can reuse in the future to have future code interact with as 'clients'.  

What I am trying to say is that when writing classes (and dealing with their APIs), I should always be thinking how any challanges/hardships should be
ideally dealt with internally since the majority of the time other code interacts with it, the other code will be a client.  Hmm I don't think my 
wording here exactly captures what I am trying to say... 

To do this, I ask myself "What if I ranked the potential consequences/characteristics/setbacks of the possible decisions relative
to each other on a scale from  

                                  (anything slightly above 'straight-up-will-not-compile' would fit here, e.g. perhaps this
        WORST                         decision will guarantee any client code using my code will always leak all of a user's 
                                      stored credit-card information, SSNs and passwords) 



         



                                  (this will have less of an impact on [future events/client code] (note 2 self: choose 1 or the other) 
      INCIDENTAL                      than the impact a medium sized butterfly currently alive somewhere in Argentina will have on the

  +---------+
  |  WORST  |
  +---------+

    * The class is subject to frequent memory leaks without any course of remedy for client code to prevent
   
    * There become so many possible paths of execution through the client code (including perhaps routes it takes
      for recovering from a variety of thrown exceptions) that it becomes impossible to reason/work with it in 
      a debugger. 

    * A client must devote more lines of code to try/catch statements than to the actual code itself
  
    * Client code has to remember multiple non-trivial combinations of thrown error objects based off 
      various states of execution.

    * Client code must frequently consult documentation when working with this class

    * Using objects of this class results in client code which no longer legible without intense study

    * Two-phase construction prevents/breaks many common coding idioms from being possible

    * Working with objects of this class can single-handily remove all elegance from client code

    * Try/Catch statements will be required in only a handful of places
    
    * Two-Phase construction requires an additional line of code each time an object is constructed

       CONCLUSION
       Two-Phase Initialization is the better choice. No way around it. Avoid Exception Handling at all costs. Nothing sucks the fun or aesthetic simplicity out of code than the words 'try' and 'catch'.
                  (I still have enough uncertainty though that I'm not fully ready to stand behind my conclusion. This is where having those years and years of experience would really pay off)
                  

      Honestly the best way to figure this out would be to try projects using both and observing the pros/cons of actually having to do both. Anything besides this will be speculation at best. Since this isn't
      practical though, I should find someone who has had the experience of using both and getting their opinion.
