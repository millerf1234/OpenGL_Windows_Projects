-) PRINTING ENUM VALUES AS STRINGS (sorta)
     (This is really more a way to declare enums and corresponding c-strings at the same time
	 without having to do seperate declarations for each)

	 // Let's say we have a file, called 'enumstring.c' which contains the following code
	 
	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #define NAMES C(RED)C(GREEN)C(BLUE)
	 #define C(x) x,
	 enum color { NAMES TOP };
	 #undef C
	 #define C(x) #x
	 const char * const color_name[] = { names };
	 
	 int main(void) {
		printf( "The color is %s.\n", color_name[ RED] );
		printf( "There are %d colors.\n", TOP ); 
	 } 
	
   //After running, this file would print out 
			The color is RED.
			There are 3 colors.
