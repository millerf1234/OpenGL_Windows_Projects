	(side note) I have a sheet of paper with more information, maybe one day I will transfer
				more of that information from my paper to this file. Unfortunatly time constraints
				prevent a large number of my beginnings from ending. 

The idea here is to have a modular buffer system. After several failed attempts at writing a unified 
buffer system using one class, I kept running into the issue of there being multiple different
possibilites for implementing the same task (updating buffer, reading/writing, etc...). Thus
it seemed like moving to a generic plug-and-play system would be the natural way to go. 
The implementation should try to not sacrifice speed beyond the scope of directly increasing
useability. 

Having a modular buffer system is the correct way to go


                         Module Catagories

Module Name:    Buffer Type     |   Allocation Type     |   Mapping         |
       Type:     (choose one)	|   (Combinable)        |	(Combinable)    |
 Selections:   -----------------|------------------------------------------------------
					Array	    |	Mappable			|   Read            |
					Element		|   Dynamic             |   Write           |
					Uniform		|	Read/Write enabled  |   Persistent      |
					Pixel		|	Coherent		    |   Flush Explicit  |
					Texture		|   Client Storage      |   Unsynchronized  |
					etc...		|						|                   |
							    |						|                   |
								   
The various Buffer Types will be what are created publically by outside code
